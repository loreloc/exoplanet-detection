# Exoplanets detection using Auto-Tuned Random Forest
## Abstract
The __NASA Kepler__ project consists of discovering exoplanets (i.e. planets outside our solar system).
The data generated by the __Kepler Telescope__ is analyzed by humans and algorithms to discover new exoplanets.
The main problem is that a lot of exoplanets are revealed false positives.
This work consists of identifying exoplanets using random forest, a _Supervised Machine Learning_ model.
Furthermore, the fitted model is analyzed in order to determine which features are relevant.
The hyperparameters are automatically optimized with techniques that come from the __AutoML__ research.
In fact, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized and cross-validated with __Hyperband__, a simple yet effective and scalable method for hyperparameters optimization.
