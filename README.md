# Exoplanets detection using auto-tuned random forest
## Abstract
This work consists of identifying exoplanets using random forest which hyperparameters are automatically optimized with techniques that come from the _AutoML_ research.
The model is trained using the processed data that comes from the _NASA Kepler_ project of discovering exoplanets (i.e. planets outside our solar system).
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized and cross-validated with _Hyperband_, a simple yet effective and scalable method for hyperparameters optimization.
The dataset used in this work can be found (here)[https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu].
